This project was developed to help the **Eberhardt School of Business (ESB)** track complete student journeys — including academic progress, internships, organization involvement, and post-graduation job placements.

The system collects information through a **guided multi-step form** and stores data securely in an **SQLite relational database**.  
It ensures accuracy, reduces manual workload, and provides a strong foundation for dashboards and analytics.
